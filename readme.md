🌾 Crop Recommendation System with State-wise Yield Insights  
🚀 Smart Agricultural Advisory with Streamlit & Map Visualization

A machine learning-powered system that helps farmers or agri-enthusiasts determine the best crop to grow among four options based on their input conditions — and estimates expected yield per hectare. The app also includes an interactive map showing state-wise average production data for the selected crop.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

📌 Features  
✅ ML model trained to recommend the best of 4 crops based on user inputs.  
✅ Predicts **expected crop yield per hectare** based on real-world data.  
✅ Interactive **map visualization** of average state-wise production.  
✅ Built with **Streamlit** for an intuitive and fast web experience.  
✅ Clean UI with integrated input forms and dynamic map rendering.  
✅ Model saved and deployed for real-time predictions.

🧠 Model Training & Evaluation  
Features Used:
- Soil and environmental parameters like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, rainfall, etc.
- Trained using supervised machine learning on agricultural datasets.

Model:
- Algorithm: (e.g., Random Forest / Decision Tree / XGBoost — based on your actual model)
- Input: User-provided agricultural parameters
- Output: Recommended crop + predicted yield (kg/hectare)

Evaluation:
- Accuracy: (insert actual value)
- Train/Test Split: e.g., 80/20
- Scaled and validated with appropriate metrics.

🗺️ State-wise Crop Production Map  
- Visualizes average production (in tons/hectare) by Indian states for the selected crop.  
- Highlights regional trends in productivity.  
- Built using (e.g., `plotly`, `folium`, or `geopandas`) integrated into Streamlit.

⚖️ Ethical Considerations
This system is for educational and advisory purposes.
We acknowledge that:
Predictions are data-driven and can vary by location or conditions not captured in the dataset.
Local expert consultation is still important.
Yield prediction assumes average practices and may not account for pests, extreme weather, etc.
